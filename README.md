## ASYNC JS
**In this lecture we'll be covering Async JS using promises and Callbacks**

What is ASYNC JS => 
ASync JS is a way of handling JavaScript code execution in a non-blocking way. In synchronous JavaScript, the browser will execute each line of code one after the other and will not move on to the next line until the current one is completed. **This can cause the browser to freeze or become unresponsive if a script takes a long time to execute.**

Async JavaScript, on the other hand, allows the browser to continue executing other code while a script is running. This is achieved through the use of callback functions, promises, and async/await.

**Look at the ![Promise.js](promise.js) and the ![Callback.js](callback.js) files for more info**
